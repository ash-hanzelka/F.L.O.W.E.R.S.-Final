Look no further for the contents which helped this product grow!

From the embedded C++ code (developed in Arduino) that drove all of the electrical functionality, to the Flutter code which provided a beautiful ios-based mobile application, and even the HTML code creating a one-stop-shop for all things F.L.O.W.E.R.S., this repository will show the ins-and-outs of the development stage and how they helped our group achieve a flourishing project!
